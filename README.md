# Fault-Detection-and-Diagnosis-for-Digital-Circuits

This project basically confirms the fault present in the circuit. The following is the algorithm used for it:

1.) In this, there is a class Gate, the code take the input file and stores every equation in an vector which stores pair of type int, Gate in the given way:

``
{output , {gate type, first input, second input}}
``

let's say we have first equation as net_e = A & B 

``
{"net_e" , {"&","A","B}}
``

This way we store all the equations

2.) Nextly, there is an unordered map storing the values generated by the equations one by one. For example: net_e = A ^ B, For test case A=0 B=1, it stores 1

``
"net_e" : 1
``

This way we can easily go to Z. Also it stores value for faulty node for SA0 - 1 and for SA1 - 0

3.) At last, we generate all the possible inputs for [A,B,C,D] and find corresponding output and print them in the output file.
## Roadmap & Environment to run code

- Make an circuit.txt and an output.txt files
- In the circuit.txt file, write the equations. Write the equations with having space between everyone. For example: "net_e = ~ B" as i have split them by space. It can be done using if else condition also but in the code i have done it using split.
- The inputs like faultNode and faultType. Give them in int main function.
